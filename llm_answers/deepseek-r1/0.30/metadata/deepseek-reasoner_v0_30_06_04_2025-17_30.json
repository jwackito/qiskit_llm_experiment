        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to create a detailed Markdown table summarizing the migration scenarios for Qiskit 0.30.0 based on the provided release notes. Let me start by carefully analyzing the information given in the primary source.\n\nFirst, the release notes mention changes in Aer 0.9.0. Let's look through each section: New Features, Known Issues, Upgrade Notes, Deprecation Notes, and Other Notes.\n\nStarting with the New Features. There's the addition of support for parallel execution using a Dask distributed. The example shows configuring the backend with max_job_size and a custom executor. This seems like a new feature, so I need to categorize it as an insertion. The module is qiskit-aer. The flow would be from the previous version to 0.30.0, so maybe 0.8.x → 0.9.0. The artifact here is the AerSimulator class. The pre-migration code might not have these options, and the post-migration code uses the new parameters. Difficulty is moderate because it requires setting up the executor. Impact is both SE and QSE since it's about execution setup and quantum simulations.\n\nNext, the new supported basis gates SXdgGate and CUGate. This is an update in the AerSimulator. The artifact is the basis gates configuration. The pre-migration code might not include these gates, and the post-migration does. Difficulty is low as it's just adding gates. Impact is QSE since it affects quantum gates.\n\nThen, support for PauliGate in simulations. Another update in AerSimulator. Similar to the previous, but for PauliGate. Difficulty low, QSE impact.\n\nThe parameter_binds addition in the run method. This is an insertion of a new kwarg. The artifact is the run method. Pre-migration code doesn't use parameter_binds, post does. Difficulty moderate because users need to adjust how they pass parameters. Impact QSE as it's about parameterized circuits.\n\nPulseSimulator now accepting QuantumCircuit. Previously it only took Schedule. This is a structural change. The artifact is PulseSimulator's run method. Pre-migration uses Schedule, post uses QuantumCircuit. Difficulty moderate as users need to transpile circuits. Impact QSE and SE since it involves both quantum circuits and backend execution.\n\nIn Upgrade Notes, the default basis gates for NoiseModel changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"]. This is an update. Artifact is NoiseModel. Pre-migration uses old basis, post explicitly sets new. Difficulty low, impact QSE as it's about noise models.\n\nRemoval of backend_options kwarg. This is a removal. The artifact is the run method. Pre-migration uses backend_options, post uses separate kwargs. Difficulty moderate because users need to adjust all their run options. Impact SE as it's API change.\n\nDeprecation Notes: Passing assembled qobj to run() is deprecated. So this is a deprecation. Artifact is run method. Pre uses qobj, post uses circuits. Difficulty high since it changes how jobs are submitted. Impact SE and QSE.\n\nDeprecation of snapshot instructions in aer.extensions. Users should use aer.library save instructions. This is a deprecation. Artifact is the snapshot classes. Pre uses snapshots, post uses save. Difficulty moderate, impact QSE.\n\nDeprecation of non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel. Users need to add noise manually. Deprecation type. Artifact is NoiseModel. Pre adds non-local errors, post uses custom passes. Difficulty high as it requires transpiler changes. Impact QSE.\n\nDeprecation of method='GPU' in Statevector/UnitarySimulator, replaced by device='GPU'. Update in parameters. Pre uses method='GPU', post device='GPU'. Difficulty low, impact SE.\n\nOther Notes mention performance improvements in matrix_product_state. This is an update but no migration needed. Maybe not a migration scenario, so exclude.\n\nNow, checking each entry to ensure atomicity and no duplication. For example, the basis gates change for NoiseModel and the default basis gates are separate from other changes. Each deprecation is a separate row.\n\nReferences need to point to the release notes provided, but since the user didn't give URLs, maybe just note as Release Notes. However, the user mentioned secondary sources, but the primary source is the given text. So references can be \"Release Notes\" for each.\n\nLet me structure each row accordingly, making sure each scenario is independent, with valid pre and post code examples where possible, and difficulty and impact properly justified."
