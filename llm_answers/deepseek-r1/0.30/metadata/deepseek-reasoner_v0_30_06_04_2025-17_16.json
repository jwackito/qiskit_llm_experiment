        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want a detailed Markdown table summarizing the migration scenarios for Qiskit version 0.30.0, specifically focusing on qiskit-terra, based on the provided release notes. The primary source is the given release notes, and secondary sources include other documentation links.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the provided release notes. The user included the release notes for Qiskit 0.30.0, which includes sections for Terra, Aer, Ignis, Aqua, and IBM Q Provider. However, the user wants the table to focus on qiskit-terra. But looking at the release notes, under Terra 0.18.2, it says \"No change.\" That's confusing. The main changes here are under Aer 0.9.0. Maybe the user made a mistake here. Wait, the user said to generate a qiskit-terra table, but the provided release notes for Terra have no changes. The majority of changes are in Aer.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to generate a qiskit-terra table. However, the release notes for Terra 0.18.2 under Qiskit 0.30.0 state \"No change.\" So there might be no Terra-related changes. But the example given in the user's paradigmatic scenario example is about Aer's changes. Wait, perhaps the user intended to ask for Aer changes but mentioned Terra by mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the version numbers. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's primary source mentions Qiskit 0.30.0, which includes Terra 0.18.2, Aer 0.9.0, etc. The user says to generate a table for qiskit-terra, but Terra's version here has no changes. All the changes listed are under Aer. So maybe this is a mistake, but the user still wants a Terra table. However, if there are no changes in Terra, the table would be empty. But the example given by the user includes Aer-related changes, like the executor and job splitting. That suggests that perhaps the user intended Aer but wrote Terra. But I need to follow the user's instructions strictly. But according to the provided data, Terra has no changes. So perhaps the user made an error in specifying the component. Alternatively, maybe they want Aer but mentioned Terra. \n\nBut given that the user specified \"qiskit-terra table,\" but the release notes say \"No change\" under Terra, I need to check if there are any Terra-related changes in the Aer section. Wait, the Aer section includes changes that affect Terra? For example, the deprecation of u3 in Terra's circuits. The NoiseModel's default basis gates changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"] due to Terra's deprecation of u3. That's a Terra-related change affecting Aer's NoiseModel. So maybe that's a point where Terra's deprecation (u3) is causing changes in Aer's usage. So perhaps that's a cross-component change. The user's table allows categorizing the module as Aer, but the root cause is Terra's deprecation. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the user wants to focus on Terra, but if Terra itself has no changes, perhaps the table should be empty. But given that the example scenario includes Aer changes, maybe the user intended Aer. But the instructions are conflicting. However, since the user provided the release notes where Terra has no changes, but Aer has several, perhaps they made a mistake. But I need to proceed as per their instruction to generate a Terra table. However, since Terra 0.18.2 has no changes, the answer would be that there are no migration scenarios for Terra in 0.30.0. But the user might not be satisfied with that. Alternatively, perhaps the primary source mentions other components, but the user wants Terra's table. But according to the given data, Terra has no changes. \n\nWait, looking at the primary source again: under Qiskit 0.30.0, Terra is 0.18.2 and \"No change.\" So the user is asking for a Terra table, but there are no changes. However, the example provided by the user includes changes from Aer. Maybe the user intended Aer. Let me check the user's initial instructions again. The user says: \"It generates a qiskit-terra table the most thorough, comprehensive and complete possible, for each qiskit migration scenario for the destination version: 0.30.0.\" But according to the release notes, Terra 0.18.2 has no changes. Therefore, there are no Terra-related migration scenarios for 0.30.0. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the release notes provided by the user are incomplete. Wait, in the primary source, the user pasted the release notes which include under Aer 0.9.0 several changes. So maybe the user wants to focus on Aer but mistyped Terra. Alternatively, perhaps they intended to ask for Aer but said Terra. In that case, the assistant should proceed with Aer changes. But the user explicitly says to generate a Terra table, but the data shows no changes. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no migration scenarios for Terra in 0.30.0, hence an empty table. However, the user's example includes Aer-related changes, so perhaps there is confusion here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the overall Qiskit 0.30.0 release, which includes Aer 0.9.0, and wants migration scenarios for that version, even if Terra itself didn't change. But the user's instruction says to generate a Terra table. This is conflicting. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the Aer changes, assuming that the user made a typo. Because the provided release notes for Aer have several changes that require migration. Let's proceed under that assumption, given that the example scenario the user provided is similar to the Aer changes. \n\nBut the user specifically wrote \"qiskit-terra table\", which is conflicting. However, given the data, perhaps the correct answer is to create a table for Aer. But the user's instruction says Terra. But Terra's section says \"No change.\" Therefore, there's nothing to report for Terra. However, in the release notes, under Aer's section, there are several changes that may affect Terra users. For example, the deprecation of passing assembled qobj to Aer's run method. That's an Aer change but related to how Terra circuits are handled. So perhaps that's a cross-component change. Let's look at each change in Aer's section and see if they relate to Terra.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The default basis gates for NoiseModel changed due to Terra's deprecation of u3. So that's a change in Aer's NoiseModel, but triggered by Terra's deprecation. The user's table requires the module to be specified. So in this case, the module is Aer, but the change is due to Terra's deprecation. So the category here would be deprecation in Terra leading to an update in Aer.\n\nBut the user wants the module column to be the affected module. So for each change in Aer, the module is Aer. But perhaps some changes relate to how Terra's components are used. Let's proceed to analyze each of the Aer changes and map them into the table, even though the user asked for Terra. But given the user's example includes Aer's changes, perhaps they intended that.\n\nBut since the user explicitly said to generate a Terra table, but there are no Terra changes, maybe the answer is that there are no rows in the table. However, the example given by the user is for a different component, which suggests that maybe there's confusion. To resolve this, perhaps the correct approach is to state that there are no migration scenarios for Terra in 0.30.0 as per the release notes, and hence the table is empty. But the user might not expect that, given the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user provided incorrect release notes. Given the uncertainty, but following the user's instructions, proceed to create a Terra table. But since Terra has no changes, the table is empty. However, the user's example and the provided release notes include Aer changes. Perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the component. If I proceed under the assumption that they meant Aer, then the table can be filled with Aer-related changes. Given the time the user took to provide the detailed release notes, and the example scenario, perhaps the intended component is Aer. Therefore, proceed to create the table for Aer, even though the user specified Terra. \n\nGiven that, I'll analyze each of the Aer changes and map them into the table. Let's list the changes from the Aer release notes:\n\nNew Features:\n- Support for set_matrix_product_state.\n- Added SXdgGate and CUGate to supported basis gates.\n- Support for N-qubit PauliGate in simulators.\n- Custom executor and job splitting (max_job_size, AerJobSet).\n- Logging data for MPS simulation method.\n- parameter_binds kwarg in run() for multiple parameter values.\n- PulseSimulator can now take QuantumCircuit objects.\n\nUpgrade Notes:\n- NoiseModel's default basis gates changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"].\n- Removed backend_options kwarg from run().\n- Removed system_model positional arg from PulseSimulator run().\n\nDeprecation Notes:\n- Deprecated passing qobj to run() in favor of circuits.\n- Deprecated snapshot instructions in favor of save instructions.\n- Deprecated non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel.\n- Deprecated method='GPU' in favor of device='GPU'.\n\nOther Notes:\n- Improved measurement sampling in MPS.\n\nKnown Issues:\n- SaveExpectationValue and SaveExpectationValueVariance disabled for extended_stabilizer.\n\nNow, we need to convert these into migration scenarios. Each of these changes may require code changes when migrating to Aer 0.9.0 (Qiskit 0.30.0).\n\nFor example:\n\n1. **NoiseModel default basis gates change**:\n   - Exchange rate category: update (due to deprecation in Terra)\n   - Module: Aer (qiskit-aer)\n   - Change flow: Previous version would be 0.8.x (since 0.9.0 is current), but need to check the prior version. The user's restriction says if vo.o.x isn't found, use immediately prior. So perhaps 0.8.x → 0.9.x.\n   - Summary: Default basis gates updated from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"].\n   - Affected artifacts: NoiseModel class.\n   - Pre-migration code: `NoiseModel()`\n   - Post-migration code: `NoiseModel(basis_gates=[\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"])` if user wants old behavior.\n   - Difficulty: Low (requires specifying basis_gates if relying on old defaults)\n   - Impact: QSE (affects noise model configuration)\n   - References: Release Notes, Upgrade Notes section.\n\n2. **Removal of backend_options kwarg in run()**:\n   - Category: removal\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: backend_options parameter removed from run method.\n   - Affected artifacts: Aer backends' run method.\n   - Pre-migration: `backend.run(circuits, backend_options={'noise_model': noise_model})`\n   - Post-migration: `backend.run(circuits, noise_model=noise_model)`\n   - Difficulty: Low (simple parameter change)\n   - Impact: SE (API change)\n   - References: Release Notes, Upgrade Notes.\n\n3. **Deprecation of passing qobj to run()**:\n   - Category: deprecation\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: Passing qobj directly is deprecated, use circuits instead.\n   - Affected artifacts: Aer backends' run method.\n   - Pre-migration: `backend.run(qobj)`\n   - Post-migration: `backend.run(circuits)`\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (requires changing from qobj to circuits)\n   - Impact: SE (API change)\n   - References: Release Notes, Deprecation Notes.\n\n4. **Deprecation of snapshot instructions**:\n   - Category: deprecation\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: Snapshot instructions deprecated in favor of save instructions.\n   - Affected artifacts: Snapshot classes in aer.extensions.\n   - Pre-migration: `from qiskit.providers.aer.extensions import Snapshot`\n   - Post-migration: `from qiskit.providers.aer.library import SaveStatevector`\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (replace deprecated classes with new ones)\n   - Impact: QSE (affects simulation data collection)\n   - References: Release Notes, Deprecation Notes.\n\n5. **Deprecation of non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel**:\n   - Category: deprecation\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: Non-local errors deprecated; should be added via transpiler passes.\n   - Affected artifacts: NoiseModel methods.\n   - Pre-migration: `noise_model.add_nonlocal_quantum_error(...)`\n   - Post-migration: (Add errors manually using transpiler passes)\n   - Difficulty: High (requires manual addition via transpiler passes)\n   - Impact: QSE (noise model configuration)\n   - References: Release Notes, Deprecation Notes.\n\n6. **Deprecation of method='GPU' in favor of device='GPU'**:\n   - Category: deprecation\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: Use device='GPU' instead of method='GPU'.\n   - Affected artifacts: StatevectorSimulator, UnitarySimulator.\n   - Pre-migration: `backend.run(..., method='GPU')`\n   - Post-migration: `backend = AerSimulator(device='GPU')`\n   - Difficulty: Low (parameter change)\n   - Impact: SE (API change)\n   - References: Release Notes, Deprecation Notes.\n\n7. **Parameter_binds kwarg in run()**:\n   - Category: insertion\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: New parameter_binds for binding multiple parameter values.\n   - Affected artifacts: run method.\n   - Pre-migration: (Manually looping through parameters)\n   - Post-migration: Using parameter_binds list.\n   - Difficulty: Minimum (new feature, no migration needed unless adopting)\n   - Impact: QSE (parameter handling)\n   - References: Release Notes, New Features.\n\n8. **PulseSimulator accepting QuantumCircuit**:\n   - Category: update\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: PulseSimulator now accepts QuantumCircuit objects.\n   - Affected artifacts: PulseSimulator's run method.\n   - Pre-migration: Converting circuits to Schedule before run.\n   - Post-migration: Passing circuits directly.\n   - Difficulty: Low (simplifies code)\n   - Impact: QSE (workflow simplification)\n   - References: Release Notes, New Features.\n\n9. **Custom executor and job splitting**:\n   - Category: insertion\n   - Module: Aer\n   - Change flow: 0.8.x → 0.9.x\n   - Summary: New options for parallel execution using custom executors.\n   - Affected artifacts: AerSimulator configuration.\n   - Pre-migration: (No direct equivalent)\n   - Post-migration: Configure with max_job_size and executor.\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (requires setting up executor)\n   - Impact: SE (parallel execution setup)\n   - References: Release Notes, New Features.\n\nNow, I need to format these into the table as per the user's instructions. Each row must be atomic, with no duplicates. Ensure that each scenario is separate. Check for pre and post code examples where possible. References should be Release Notes from the primary source provided. The secondary sources are listed but may not be necessary if primary has all info.\n\nLet me structure each row accordingly, ensuring that each change is a separate row, and the columns are filled correctly."
