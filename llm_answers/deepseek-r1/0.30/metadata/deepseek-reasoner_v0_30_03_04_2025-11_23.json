        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a comprehensive Markdown table about migration scenarios in Qiskit version 0.30.0 based on the provided release notes. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the release notes given in triple quotes. The main sections to focus on are Aer 0.9.0, specifically under New Features, Upgrade Notes, Deprecation Notes, and Other Notes. Terra, Ignis, Aqua, and IBM Q Provider have no changes, so they can be ignored.\n\nStarting with Aer 0.9.0's New Features. The first new feature is support for setting a custom executor and job splitting. The example shows using AerSimulator with max_job_size and executor. The change here is adding new parameters to the AerSimulator. So this is an API update. The affected artifacts are AerSimulator's run method, and the parameters max_job_size and executor. The difficulty is Low since it's adding new optional parameters. The impact is SE because it's about execution configuration.\n\nNext, the parameter_binds keyword argument in the run method. Previously, maybe parameters were handled differently, now there's a specific parameter. This is an API update. The code example shows using parameter_binds, so pre-migration code might have used a different method for parameter binding. The difficulty is Low as it's a straightforward parameter addition. Impact is QSE since it's related to circuit execution with parameters.\n\nPulseSimulator now accepts QuantumCircuit objects. Previously, it only took Schedule. This is an API update. The code example shows running a circuit directly. Pre-migration would require converting to Schedule first. So the post-migration code simplifies this. Difficulty is Moderate because users might need to adjust their code if they were manually converting circuits. Impact is QSE as it's about pulse-level simulation.\n\nUpgrade Notes: The default basis gates for NoiseModel changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"]. This is a default change, so Type of Change is Default Value Change. Users who relied on the old default need to set basis_gates explicitly. Difficulty is Moderate because it might affect noise model behavior. Impact is QSE as it's related to noise simulation.\n\nDeprecation Notes: The backend_options kwarg in run is removed. Now, all options are passed as separate kwargs. So pre-migration code might have used backend_options dictionary. Post-migration code uses individual parameters. This is a deprecation. Difficulty is Low as it's replacing a dictionary with individual args. Impact is SE because it's an API parameter change.\n\nDeprecation of passing assembled qobj to run(). Now, circuits should be passed directly. This is a deprecation. Pre-migration code used qobj, post uses circuits. Difficulty is Moderate because users need to stop using qobj. Impact is SE as it's about input format.\n\nDeprecation of snapshot instructions in aer.extensions. They should use save instructions from aer.library. So pre-migration uses Snapshot, post uses Save instructions. Difficulty is Moderate as it requires replacing deprecated classes. Impact is QSE as it's about simulation data.\n\nDeprecation of non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel. Users should add noise manually. This is a deprecation. Difficulty is High because it requires reworking how noise is applied. Impact is QSE.\n\nDeprecation of method option for GPU simulation in StatevectorSimulator. Now use device='GPU'. Pre-migration code uses method='statevector_gpu', post uses device='GPU'. Difficulty is Low, just parameter change. Impact is SE/QSE.\n\nOther Notes mention the mps_sample_measure_algorithm default change. This is a default change. Users might need to set the option explicitly if they relied on the old behavior. Difficulty is Low. Impact is QSE.\n\nNow, each of these points needs to be a row in the table. I need to ensure each row is unique in Type, Summary, and Affected Artifacts. For example, different deprecations are separate rows.\n\nCheck for all required columns: Change Type, Change Flow (source→target versions), Summary, Affected Artifacts, Pre/Post code, Difficulty with justification, SE/QSE Impact, References.\n\nFor the Change Flow, since the target is 0.30.0, and Aer is part of that, the source would be versions before 0.30.0. The release notes are for Aer 0.9.0, which is part of Qiskit 0.30.0. So the source versions could be 0.8.x → 0.9.0, but according to the user's example, the Change Flow is in the format like 0.45.x → 1.0.0. Since the target here is 0.30.0, and Aer 0.9.0 is included, perhaps the source is 0.8.x → 0.9.0. But the user's example shows source and target as Qiskit versions. Wait, the user's example has \"0.45.x → 1.0.0\" for a new library. But in the primary source given, the Qiskit version is 0.30.0, with Aer 0.9.0. So perhaps the Change Flow should be Qiskit versions. The user's example shows \"0.45.x → 1.0.0\". But the given primary source is Qiskit 0.30.0. So maybe the Change Flow is for the component versions. For example, Aer 0.8.x → 0.9.0. But the user's instructions say \"Change Flow\" is source and target qiskit versions. Since the overall Qiskit version is 0.30.0, and Aer is part of it, perhaps the Change Flow is previous Qiskit versions to 0.30.0. However, Qiskit's versioning might have Aer as a separate package. The user's example shows \"0.45.x → 1.0.0\" as Qiskit versions. But in the given release notes, the Aer version is 0.9.0. So perhaps for the Change Flow, it's better to use the component versions. But the user's example uses the overall Qiskit version. This is a bit confusing. The user says \"Source and target qiskit versions\". So even if the component is Aer, the versions would be Qiskit versions. But in reality, Qiskit metapackage versions and component versions are different. For example, Qiskit 0.30.0 includes Terra 0.18.2, Aer 0.9.0, etc. So perhaps the Change Flow should refer to the component versions. But the user's example seems to use the overall Qiskit version. Hmm. The user's example shows a row with \"0.45.x → 1.0.0\" as Change Flow, which likely refers to Qiskit versions. However, in the given primary source, the Qiskit version is 0.30.0, and the component versions are Terra 0.18.2, Aer 0.9.0, etc. The user's instructions also mention that the target version is 0.30.0. So, for the Change Flow, perhaps the source is a previous Qiskit version (like 0.29.x) and target is 0.30.0. But the actual component changes (like Aer 0.8 → 0.9) are part of Qiskit 0.30.0. However, the user's example uses component versions in the paradigmatic example. Wait, the paradigmatic example says \"New Library | **0.45.x** → **1.0.0** | ...\". That seems to be the component version, not the Qiskit metapackage. So maybe the Change Flow refers to the component versions. But the user's primary source is Qiskit 0.30.0, which includes Aer 0.9.0. Therefore, in the table, the Change Flow for Aer changes should be from Aer 0.8.x to 0.9.0. But the user's example uses Qiskit versions. This is conflicting. However, the user's instructions under \"Critical restrictions\" for Column 2 say \"Change Flow\" as \"o.o.x → d.d.0\", with source ≥0.05.x and target ≤0.30.0. So perhaps the Change Flow is for the component versions. For example, Aer 0.8.x → 0.9.0. But how to represent that? The user's example shows \"0.45.x → 1.0.0\", which could be a component version. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the Qiskit metapackage version. But given that the release notes mention Aer 0.9.0 as part of Qiskit 0.30.0, maybe the Change Flow is Aer's version. However, the user's instructions are a bit ambiguous. Since the paradigmatic example uses component versions (qiskit-dynamics introduced in 1.0.0), but the main Qiskit version is 0.30.0, perhaps the Change Flow should use the component versions. So for Aer changes, the source is 0.8.x → 0.9.0. But the user's target is Qiskit 0.30.0. Hmm. This is a bit unclear, but given the example, I'll proceed with the component versions for Change Flow, like Aer 0.8.x → 0.9.0.\n\nNow, checking the references. The user wants links to official sources in order: Release Notes, Changelog GitHub, Official Documentation, Migration Guides. For each row, find the appropriate link. The primary source is the given release notes, which are part of Qiskit 0.30.0. The Aer 0.9.0 release notes are part of that. So the Release Notes link is https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes#0.30.0. The GitHub changelog for Qiskit 0.30.0 is https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/releases/tag/0.30.0. However, Aer's specific changes might be in its own GitHub repo. But the user's instructions say to use the primary source provided, which is the Qiskit 0.30.0 release notes. Therefore, all references should point to the Qiskit 0.30.0 Release Notes and any other official links mentioned. For example, some deprecations might have migration guides. But according to the user's instructions, only use the sources provided in the triple quotes. Since the primary source includes the Aer 0.9.0 release notes, the references should link to the Qiskit 0.30.0 release notes. However, in the given primary source, there's a mention of a GitHub issue (#1227), but the user says not to use bug fixes. So for References, each row should have the Release Notes link for Qiskit 0.30.0. But in the example paradigmatic row, the references include both Release Notes and Migration Guides. However, the provided primary source doesn't mention Migration Guides, so perhaps only the Release Notes link is available. Alternatively, check if there's a migration guide for 0.30.0. The user provided a link to migration guides as https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides, but if the specific migration guide for 0.30.0 exists, it should be included. However, given the primary source is the release notes, perhaps only that is needed. \n\nFor each row, the References column should include the Release Notes link. For example, the AerSimulator's custom executor is mentioned in the New Features section of the provided release notes, so the link would be https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes#0.30.0. However, the exact anchor might vary. Since the user's example includes [Release Notes](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes#1.0.0), maybe append #0.30.0 to the base URL. But the actual structure might differ. For the sake of the answer, use the base Release Notes URL provided by the user: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes#0.30.0.\n\nNow, constructing each row:\n\n1. **Custom Executor and Job Splitting in AerSimulator**\n   - Type: API Update\n   - Change Flow: Aer 0.8.x → 0.9.0 (but per user's example, maybe Qiskit versions. Since the user's target is 0.30.0, perhaps source is 0.29.x → 0.30.0. But the component version is Aer 0.9.0. This is confusing. The user's example shows \"0.45.x → 1.0.0\" for a new library. So perhaps in this case, the Change Flow is Qiskit versions. Since Qiskit 0.30.0 includes Aer 0.9.0, the previous Qiskit version would be 0.29.x, which included Aer 0.8.x. So Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0. That makes sense. So source is 0.29.x, target 0.30.0.\n   - Summary: Added support for custom executors and job splitting in AerSimulator.\n   - Affected Artifacts: AerSimulator, max_job_size, executor parameters.\n   - Pre-Migration Code: Not needed, as it's a new feature.\n   - Post-Migration Code: The example given.\n   - Difficulty: Low (new parameters are optional).\n   - Impact: SE (execution configuration).\n   - References: Release Notes link.\n\n2. **parameter_binds in run()**\n   - Type: API Update\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: Added parameter_binds kwarg for binding parameters in AerSimulator.run()\n   - Affected Artifacts: AerSimulator.run(), parameter_binds\n   - Pre-Migration Code: Maybe using bind_parameters before run.\n   - Post-Migration Code: As given in the example.\n   - Difficulty: Low\n   - Impact: QSE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n3. **PulseSimulator accepts QuantumCircuit**\n   - Type: API Update\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: PulseSimulator now accepts QuantumCircuit input directly.\n   - Affected Artifacts: PulseSimulator.run()\n   - Pre-Migration Code: Converting circuits to Schedule manually.\n   - Post-Migration Code: The example shows running the circuit directly.\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (users need to remove conversion steps)\n   - Impact: QSE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n4. **NoiseModel default basis gates change**\n   - Type: Default Value Change\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: Default basis gates for NoiseModel changed to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"].\n   - Affected Artifacts: NoiseModel, basis_gates parameter.\n   - Pre-Migration Code: Using default basis gates.\n   - Post-Migration Code: Explicitly setting basis_gates=[\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] if needed.\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (may affect existing noise models)\n   - Impact: QSE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n5. **backend_options deprecated in run()**\n   - Type: Deprecation\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: backend_options kwarg removed; use individual run options.\n   - Affected Artifacts: Aer backends' run() method.\n   - Pre-Migration Code: backend.run(..., backend_options={...})\n   - Post-Migration Code: backend.run(..., shots=1000, ...)\n   - Difficulty: Low (replace kwargs)\n   - Impact: SE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n6. **Deprecate passing qobj to run()**\n   - Type: Deprecation\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: Passing qobj to Aer backends' run() is deprecated.\n   - Affected Artifacts: Aer backends' run() method.\n   - Pre-Migration Code: backend.run(qobj)\n   - Post-Migration Code: backend.run(circuits)\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (need to stop using qobj)\n   - Impact: SE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n7. **Deprecate snapshot instructions**\n   - Type: Deprecation\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: Snapshot instructions deprecated; use save instructions.\n   - Affected Artifacts: qiskit.providers.aer.extensions, aer.library.\n   - Pre-Migration Code: from qiskit.providers.aer.extensions import Snapshot\n   - Post-Migration Code: from qiskit.providers.aer.library import SaveStatevector\n   - Difficulty: Moderate (replace classes)\n   - Impact: QSE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n8. **Deprecate non-local quantum errors**\n   - Type: Deprecation\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: Non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel deprecated.\n   - Affected Artifacts: NoiseModel.add_nonlocal_quantum_error()\n   - Pre-Migration Code: noise_model.add_nonlocal_quantum_error(...)\n   - Post-Migration Code: Manually add noise via transpiler passes.\n   - Difficulty: High (requires manual intervention)\n   - Impact: QSE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n9. **Deprecate method option for GPU simulation**\n   - Type: Deprecation\n   - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n   - Summary: Use device='GPU' instead of method option.\n   - Affected Artifacts: StatevectorSimulator, UnitarySimulator.\n   - Pre-Migration Code: backend.run(..., method='statevector_gpu')\n   - Post-Migration Code: backend.run(..., device='GPU')\n   - Difficulty: Low (parameter change)\n   - Impact: SE/QSE\n   - References: Release Notes.\n\n10. **mps_sample_measure_algorithm default change**\n    - Type: Default Value Change\n    - Change Flow: 0.29.x → 0.30.0\n    - Summary: Default measurement algorithm for matrix_product_state method changed.\n    - Affected Artifacts: matrix_product_state simulation method, mps_sample_measure_algorithm option.\n    - Pre-Migration Code: Not setting the option (uses old default)\n    - Post-Migration Code: Set mps_sample_measure_algorithm=\"mps_probabilities\" if needed.\n    - Difficulty: Low (optional parameter)\n    - Impact: QSE\n    - References: Release Notes.\n\nNow, ensuring each row is unique in Type, Summary, and Affected Artifacts. For example, different deprecations are separate. All rows seem distinct.\n\nEach row must have valid Python code in Pre/Post columns. For example, the backend_options deprecation row has Pre-Migration Code as `backend.run(circuits, backend_options={'shots': 1000})` and Post as `backend.run(circuits, shots=1000)`.\n\nReferences column should have the Release Notes link. Since all changes are from the provided Aer 0.9.0 notes under Qiskit 0.30.0, the link is https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes#0.30.0.\n\nFinally, check for the Critical Restrictions: no replicated scenarios, valid Markdown, official links, etc."
