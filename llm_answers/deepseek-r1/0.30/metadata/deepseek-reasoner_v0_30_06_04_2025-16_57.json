        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to create a detailed Markdown table summarizing the migration scenarios for Qiskit version 0.30.0, specifically focusing on qiskit-aer based on the provided release notes. Let me go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the release notes given. The user provided the Qiskit 0.30 release notes, which include sections for Terra, Aer, and others. Since the task is to generate a table for qiskit-terra, but the release notes mention that Terra 0.18.2 has no changes, I need to check if there's any other info. Wait, the user later specifies to generate a qiskit-terra table, but the release notes under Aer have changes. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"It generates a qiskit-terra table the most thorough...\", but the provided release notes for Terra say \"No change\". However, the Aer section has several changes. Maybe the user intended Aer but wrote Terra. But I should follow the user's instructions. However, since Terra has no changes, the table might be empty. But the example given in the problem statement includes Aer changes. Perhaps there's a confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the release notes provided:\n\n- Qiskit 0.30 includes Terra 0.18.2 (no changes), Aer 0.9.0 (with changes), Ignis 0.6.0 (no changes), etc.\n\nBut the user asks for a qiskit-terra table. Since Terra has no changes in this release, the answer should reflect that. However, maybe the user made a mistake and meant Aer. Alternatively, perhaps the task is to generate a table for Aer's changes under the Terra section? That seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the Terra table even if there are no changes, but that would result in an empty table. But the example scenario provided by the user includes Aer changes. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the user's instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"Your task is to analyze and summarize the changes of the 0.30.0 version of qiskit, generating a Markdown table...\" and then later specifies \"It generates a qiskit-terra table...\". But Terra 0.18.2 has no changes. However, the provided release notes under Aer have several changes. So perhaps the user made a mistake, intending to refer to Aer. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the Terra changes from the 0.30.0 release, but according to the notes, there are none. \n\nBut in the release notes, under Aer 0.9.0, there are several changes. Since the user's example includes Aer changes (like the CUGate and SXdgGate addition), maybe the correct approach is to proceed with Aer's changes. However, the user explicitly says \"qiskit-terra table\". This is conflicting. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the user says, \"You are a expert in quantum software engineering, highly trained in the qiskit ecosystem and its version releases. Your task is to analyze and summarize the changes of the 0.30.0 version of qiskit...\". Then under critical restrictions, the primordial source is the user-provided text, which includes Aer changes. The user then says, \"It generates a qiskit-terra table...\". But Terra has no changes. This is confusing. Perhaps the user intended to refer to Aer, but wrote Terra. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the overall Qiskit 0.30 release, which includes Aer 0.9.0, and wants the Terra part of that. But Terra's part in Qiskit 0.30.0 is 0.18.2 with no changes. Therefore, the Terra table would be empty. However, the user provided an example scenario that includes Aer changes. Maybe there's a mix-up here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and intended to request an Aer table. Given that, but following the instructions strictly, the answer should state that there are no changes for Terra. However, the release notes do have changes for Aer. Maybe the user intended to ask for Aer but wrote Terra. Alternatively, perhaps the user's source text includes Aer changes, but they want Terra's part. Since Terra has no changes, the table would be empty, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the overall Qiskit 0.30 changes, including all modules, but the task says to generate a Terra table. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the Aer changes, assuming a typo in the user's request. Otherwise, if strictly following the user's instruction for Terra, the table would be empty, which is not helpful. Since the example scenario provided by the user includes Aer changes (like adding a new library), perhaps the user intended to ask for Aer. Therefore, I will proceed with creating the table for Aer's changes in version 0.9.0 as part of Qiskit 0.30.0.\n\nNow, looking at the Aer section of the release notes:\n\nNew Features:\n- Added support for set_matrix_product_state.\n- Added SXdgGate and CUGate to supported basis gates.\n- Support for PauliGate in all simulation methods.\n- Custom executor and job splitting.\n- Logging data for matrix_product_state.\n- parameter_binds kwarg in run().\n- PulseSimulator can take QuantumCircuit.\n\nUpgrade Notes:\n- NoiseModel default basis changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"].\n- Removed backend_options kwarg.\n- Removed passing system_model as positional arg to PulseSimulator run.\n\nDeprecation Notes:\n- Deprecated passing assembled qobj to run().\n- Deprecated snapshot instructions.\n- Deprecated non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel.\n- Deprecated method option for GPU simulation in favor of device='GPU'.\n\nOther Notes:\n- Performance improvements in matrix_product_state measurement sampling.\n\nNow, each of these needs to be converted into rows in the table. Let's break them down into atomic changes.\n\nFirst, the change in NoiseModel's default basis gates. This is an upgrade note. The category is 'update', module is qiskit-aer. Change flow would be from prior versions to 0.30.x. Summary: Default basis gates change. Affects NoiseModel class. Pre-migration code might use the old basis, post-migration would have the new basis. Difficulty: Low, as it's a default change, but if someone relied on the old default, they need to set it explicitly.\n\nSecond, removal of backend_options kwarg. This is a removal. Change from older versions (probably 0.7.x to 0.30.x). Summary: backend_options kwarg removed. Affects run method. Pre-migration code uses backend_options, post uses separate kwargs. Difficulty: Moderate, requires changing code to pass options as kwargs.\n\nThird, removal of system_model as positional arg in PulseSimulator.run(). Category: removal. Module: qiskit-aer. Change flow: previous → 0.30.x. Summary: system_model as positional arg removed. Affected artifact: PulseSimulator.run(). Pre-code would pass system_model positionally, post must use keyword. Difficulty: Low.\n\nDeprecation of passing qobj to run(). Category: deprecation. Module: qiskit-aer. Change flow: previous → 0.30.x. Summary: qobj input deprecated. Affected artifact: run() method. Pre-code uses run(qobj), post uses run(circuits). Difficulty: Moderate, requires changing input from qobj to circuits.\n\nDeprecation of snapshot instructions. Category: deprecation. Module: qiskit-aer. Change flow: previous → 0.30.x. Summary: Snapshot instructions deprecated in favor of save instructions. Affected artifacts: snapshot classes. Pre uses snapshots, post uses save. Difficulty: Moderate, requires replacing deprecated classes.\n\nDeprecation of non-local quantum errors in NoiseModel. Category: deprecation. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: Non-local noise addition deprecated. Affects NoiseModel. Pre-code adds non-local errors, post must use transpiler passes. Difficulty: High, requires manual addition via transpiler.\n\nDeprecation of method='GPU' in favor of device='GPU'. Category: deprecation. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: GPU method option deprecated. Affects StatevectorSimulator and UnitarySimulator. Pre uses method='GPU', post uses device='GPU'. Difficulty: Low, simple parameter change.\n\nAddition of SXdgGate and CUGate to basis gates. Category: insertion. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: New basis gates supported. Affects AerSimulator. Pre may transpile these gates, post can use natively (for some methods). Difficulty: Minimum, as it's a new feature, no migration needed unless taking advantage.\n\nSupport for PauliGate. Category: insertion. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: PauliGate supported in all simulators. Affects PauliGate. No pre-migration needed, just can use it now. Difficulty: Minimum.\n\nCustom executor and job splitting. Category: insertion. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: Custom executor and job splitting added. Affects AerSimulator. Pre no such options, post uses them. Difficulty: Minimum (new feature), unless migrating to use it, which is optional.\n\nLogging data for matrix_product_state. Category: insertion. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: Logging option added. Affects matrix_product_state method. No migration, just new option. Difficulty: Minimum.\n\nparameter_binds kwarg in run(). Category: insertion. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: New parameter_binds for parameterized circuits. Affects run() method. Pre had to bind parameters before, post can use parameter_binds. Difficulty: Minimum (new feature).\n\nPulseSimulator accepts QuantumCircuit. Category: update. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: PulseSimulator can now take circuits. Affects PulseSimulator.run(). Pre needed to transpile to Schedule, post can pass circuits. Difficulty: Low, simplifies code.\n\nPerformance improvement in matrix_product_state. Category: update. Module: qiskit-aer. Summary: Improved measurement sampling. Affects matrix_product_state method. No code change needed. Difficulty: Minimum.\n\nDeprecated non-local quantum errors: this is a deprecation requiring code changes. Need to split into separate rows if needed.\n\nNow, considering atomicity: each row must be a single change. Let's structure each of these as separate rows.\n\nLet me start building the table.\n\nFirst row: NoiseModel default basis change.\nExchange rate: update (category), module: qiskit-aer.\nChange flow: prior → 0.30.0.\nSummary: Default basis gates changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"].\nAffected artifacts: NoiseModel.\nPre-migration: NoiseModel() uses old basis.\nPost-migration: NoiseModel(basis_gates=[\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to keep old behavior.\nDifficulty: Low (just need to specify basis_gates if relying on old default).\nImpact: QSE (affects noise model configuration).\nReferences: Upgrade Notes section in release notes.\n\nSecond row: backend_options kwarg removal.\nExchange rate: removal, module: qiskit-aer.\nChange flow: prior →

method='GPU')\nPost: backend.run(..., device='GPU')\nDifficulty: Low (simple parameter change).\nImpact: SE (API parameter change).\nReferences: Deprecation Notes.\n\nEighth row: SXdgGate and CUGate support.\nExchange rate: insertion, module: qiskit-aer.\nChange flow: prior → 0.30.0.\nSummary: Added support for SXdgGate and CUGate as basis gates.\nAffected artifacts: AerSimulator.\nPre: Transpile to supported gates.\nPost: Use natively where supported.\nDifficulty: Minimum (no migration needed unless leveraging new support).\nImpact: QSE (gate support).\nReferences: New Features

Convert circuits to Schedule before running.\nPost: Pass circuits directly.\nDifficulty: Low (simplifies code).\nImpact: SE (API simplification).\nReferences: New Features.\n\nFourteenth row: Performance improvement in matrix_product_state.\nExchange rate: update, module: qiskit-aer.\nChange flow: prior → 0.30.0.\nSummary: Improved measurement sampling algorithm.\nAffected artifacts: matrix_product_state method.\nPre: Uses mps_probabilities.\nPost: Defaults to mps_apply_measure.\nDifficulty: Minimum (no code change needed).\nImpact: QSE (performance improvement).\nReferences: Other Notes.\n\nNow, check for atomicity and no duplication. Each row represents a unique change. Ensure that each has distinct exchange rate, summary, and affected artifacts.\n\nFor example, SXdgGate and CUGate support are in the same bullet point but are two gates. However, the summary mentions both, so it's one row. Similarly for PauliGate. Custom executor and job splitting is one feature. \n\nNow, format each row into the table with the specified columns. Ensure references are from the release notes provided. For example, references can be \"Release Notes\" as the user provided the release notes as the primary source. The example given by the user uses [Release Notes](link), but since the user's source is the provided text, perhaps just \"Release Notes\" without a link, or as per the user's note. However, the user's example includes links, but the actual references in the problem are within triple backticks. The user says references should be from Release Notes, Changelog, etc., but since the primary source is the given text, perhaps just \"Release Notes\" as the reference.\n\nBut in the critical restrictions, the user says references should be: Release notes, changelog GitHub, official documentation, migration guides. But given that the user provided the release notes as the source, perhaps the references column can just state \"Release Notes\" for each row, as all changes are documented there. However, the example in the problem includes links, but the user hasn't provided actual URLs except in the example. But according to the user's instructions, the references should be the correct ones. However, since the user hasn't provided real URLs, perhaps just \"Release Notes\" is acceptable. Alternatively, if the release notes link is the one provided under \"Other sources of information\", which is https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes#0.30.0, but the user's example uses [Release Notes](link), but in this case, the actual link isn't provided in the input. The user's example uses placeholders. So perhaps the references should just be \"Release Notes\" as per the primary source.\n\nBut the user's example shows references as [Release Notes](link) [Migration Guides](link), but in our case, since we only have the release notes provided, we can use \"Release Notes\" as the reference for each row where applicable. For example, changes under \"New Features\" would reference the New Features section, but since all are part of the same release notes, perhaps just \"Release Notes\".\n\nAlternatively, since the user provided the release notes as the primary source, and within that, different sections (New Features, Upgrade Notes, etc.), perhaps references can be more specific, like \"Release Notes (New Features)\", but the user's example doesn't do that. Since the user's example just uses \"Release Notes\" with a link, but we don't have the link, maybe just \"Release Notes\".\n\nNow, proceeding to fill the table:\n\nEach row needs to have the specified columns. For example, the first row:\n\n| Exchange rate | Change flow | Summary | Affected artifacts | Pre-migration code | Post-migration code | Difficulty | Impact se/qse | References |\n| :- | :-: | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |\n| update (NoiseModel) | qiskit-aer | prior → 0.30.0 | Default basis gates changed from [\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"] to [\"id\", \"rz\", \"sx\", \"cx\"] | NoiseModel | NoiseModel() | NoiseModel(basis_gates=[\"id\", \"u3\", \"cx\"]) | Low (explicit basis required) | QSE (noise model configuration) | Release Notes |\n\nWait, the Change flow column should have versions. But the release notes for Aer 0.9.0 (part of Qiskit 0.30.0) don't specify the exact prior versions. The origin version is likely 0.8.x or earlier. But the user's restriction says the origin must be >=0.05.x and destination <=0.30.x. So for example, the change flow for NoiseModel's basis gates could be 0.8.x → 0.9.0 (as part of Qiskit 0.30.0). But since the user's example uses 0.44.x → 1.0.x, which is not applicable here, perhaps the origin is prior versions leading to 0.30.0. Since Aer's version here is 0.9.0, the change flow could be 0.8.x → 0.9.0, which is part of Qiskit 0.30.0. However, the user's example uses origin → destination as versions. So for the NoiseModel change, the origin is versions before 0.9.0, so perhaps 0.8.x → 0.9.0. But the user's destination is 0.30.x (Qiskit version), but the Aer version is 0.9.0. This may cause confusion. However, the user's instruction says that the destination version is 0.30.0 for Qiskit, which includes Aer 0.9.0. So the Change flow for Aer changes should have origin as prior Aer versions (e.g., 0.8.x) → Aer 0.9.0 (Qiskit 0.30.0). But since the user's example uses Qiskit versions (0.44.x → 1.0.x), perhaps here the change flow should be prior Qiskit versions → 0.30.0. However, Aer's versioning is separate. This is a bit ambiguous, but per the user's instructions, the Change flow should be in the format Origin → Destination, with the destination being 0.30.x. Since the user's example uses Qiskit versions, and the overall Qiskit version is 0.30.0, even though Aer is 0.9.0, perhaps the Change flow should be expressed in Qiskit versions. For example, if a feature was introduced in Qiskit 0.29.0 (Aer 0.8.0), then the flow would be 0.29.x → 0.30.0. However, without specific prior Qiskit versions in the release notes, it's challenging. The release notes provided mention that the changes are for Aer 0.9.0, which is part of Qiskit 0.30.0. So perhaps the Change flow is prior Aer versions (like 0.8.x) → 0.9.0 (as part of Qiskit 0.30.0). However, the user's Change flow examples use Qiskit versions. This is conflicting. Since the user's example has 0.44.x → 1.0.x, but the current version is 0.30.0, the origin versions are likely older Qiskit versions. But since the changes are in Aer, and Aer's version is 0.9.0, perhaps the Change flow should reflect Aer's versions. However, the user's problem states that the destination is 0.30.x, which is the Qiskit version, not Aer's. This is a bit confusing, but perhaps the correct approach is to use Qiskit versions for the Change flow, even if the underlying Aer version is different. For example, if the prior Qiskit version was 0.29.x (which included Aer 0.8.x), then the Change flow would be 0.29.x → 0.30.x. But without explicit information, perhaps the safest is to use the format \"prior → 0.30.0\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, given that the user's example uses Qiskit versions (0.44.x → 1.0.x), perhaps the Change flow should be expressed as Qiskit versions. However, since the changes are in Aer, which is part of Qiskit 0.30.0, but the prior Qiskit versions (e.g., 0.29.0) included Aer 0.8.0, the Change flow for the Aer changes would be from Qiskit 0.29.x to 0.30.0. But the user's instructions don't provide prior version numbers. Therefore, perhaps it's acceptable to use \"previous versions → 0.30.0\" as the Change flow.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll proceed with \"prior → 0.30.0\" for the Change flow column.\n\nNow, filling in the table rows with all the identified changes. Each row must be atomic and unique.\n\nAfter compiling all the rows, ensuring that each meets the requirements: unique exchange rate, summary, and affected artifacts. Checking for any duplicates or merged scenarios. For example, the SXdgGate and CUGate support are in one row as they were added together. Similarly, the parameter_binds is a single feature.\n\nFinally, ensure that all references are \"Release Notes\" as per the provided source."
